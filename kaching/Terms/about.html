KaChing is an innovative new shopping app that can change the way you approach shopping. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike other shopping Apps that only sell their own products on inventory, we help you screen the best prices from multiple retailers and let you compare the best prizes in an instant. You can find information about products by simply taking a picture of a product you want to buy (or add to your shopping list). Snap a picture from TV or Magazine ads or from the innovative Shopping wall at various spots throughout your city to shop for products. Or find it by browsing through the wide selection of products within the app by searching under the specified categories or directly for brands and products.
 </p>
 <p>
Once you decided, put it into the cart and get everything processed though us. We take care of getting the products sent to you, even if they are from multiple retailers. We offer same-day delivery (in certain areas) for anything from the foods you consume everyday, to wine/spirits, health and beauty products, music, books, electronics and more. We give you a chance to take back control to a part of your day by making shopping easier through one gateway only.
